# Hello-World
My Very First Git
So I've been a developer for quite a long time, but mostly coding in a bubble
I'd like to come in from the cold, join the rest of the planet, and share my code with whomever feels
it is worth using.

Of course, I'm hoping to first learn from the many people who are somewhat beyond Hello World.
